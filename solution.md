1. Copy jenkins_url:8080 and add to webhook under your repository settings.

## Scheduled Jobs
Similar to Poll SCM, the difference is it doesn't check for commits, rather it runs the job at the scheduled time

In jenkins Job Configuration, select `Build Periodically`, write the scheduled time to run the job, and save

## Remote Triggers
This means job can be trigger from anywhere i.e from a script, jenkins server, laptop, as long as there is network access to the job.

1. Generate Job Url
Job Configure > Trigger builds remotely (e.g., from scripts) > Give a Token name > Generate URl and Save

2. Generate Token for User
username button > configure > API Token > Generate > copy token-name > save username:token-name in a file

3. Generate CRUMB
```
wget -q --auth-no-challenge --user username --password password --output-document - 'http://JENNKINS_IP:8080/crumbIssuer/api/xml?xpath=concat(//crumbRequestField,":",//crumb)'
```

## Post Job Trigger
This means triggering a job after the completion of another.

1. Create a new job, and select `Build after other projects`, in the job configuration. Chose the other project

2. Go to the other project, and build. After successful build, it will trigger the new job created.
